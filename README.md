🏠 Home System Skript Addon
Welcome to the Home System Skript Addon! This powerful and intuitive home management script is perfect for Minecraft servers of all sizes. It lets players set, teleport to, and manage multiple homes effortlessly, creating a more enjoyable and convenient gameplay experience. With easy-to-use commands, players can return to their favorite spots in no time, all while maintaining fair play with anti-combat logging features. 🌐✨

🌟 Key Features
This Skript addon is super easy to configure, making it ideal for server admins who want to customize the system to fit their server’s theme. Adjust messages, colors, and sound effects with just a few simple changes. 🎨

The combat integration is a standout feature. If a player engages in combat, they won't be able to use the /home command for 10 seconds, adding a layer of fairness and preventing combat logging. This keeps gameplay competitive and balanced. ⚔️

To ensure that teleporting remains fair and engaging, there’s a short delay before the teleport completes. If the player moves or gets attacked during this time, the teleport is canceled. This adds a sense of realism and challenge, making the home system more immersive. ⏳

For those who like to test things out before implementing them on their own servers, you can check out a live demo on our server at velocitymc.xyz. Experience the seamless home management and see how this Skript can enhance your server! 🕹️

💡 Why Choose the Home System Skript Addon?
Customization is a breeze. You can easily change the maximum number of homes a player can set, add more for players with specific permissions, or adjust messages to fit your server’s style. 🎨🛠️

The user interface is simple yet effective. Players receive clear notifications and sound effects, enhancing their experience without overwhelming them with information. This makes it accessible for players of all ages and skill levels. 🖥️📊

Performance is always a concern, but this Skript addon is lightweight and optimized to run smoothly on any Minecraft server. It ensures minimal impact on server performance, even during high player activity. ⚡️💨

⚠️ A Few Downsides
There are a few things to keep in mind. While the combat cooldown is effective, it might not cover every possible scenario where a player could abuse teleportation. 🛡️

The current home system supports a limited number of homes by default, which might not be ideal for all servers. However, this can be adjusted if you know how to tweak the settings. 🔄

The teleportation delay is great for realism but might frustrate players who are used to instant teleports. 🖼️

Lastly, the Skript does not include multi-language support out of the box, so servers with a diverse player base may need to manually translate and customize the messages. 🌍
